Why call it a decision tree? This is because you make a bunch of choices until you get to the final decision and the processes are shaped like a tree with all those branches.

**Regression trees**

Trees are drawn upside down. The final regions are termed `leaves`. `Node` is where a split occurs.

To create a regression tree.
