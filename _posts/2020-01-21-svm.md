title: Build SVM From Scratch in Python
subtitle: Implementation

Before we dive into the code part, lets see some math equations.
- For all **x** in training Data:
~~~
 xi.w + b <= -1   if yi = -1 (belongs to -ve class)
 xi.w + b >= +1	if yi = +1 (belongs to +ve class)
~~~
- For all support vectors which decide the margin
~~~
xi.w+b = -1    here xi is -ve SV and yi is -1
xi.w+b = +1    here xi is +ve SV and yi is +1
~~~
- For decision boudary `yi(xi.w+b)=0`
- Our goal is maximize Width **W**
~~~
W = ((X+ - X-).w)/|w|
~~~
- The goal is to minimize ||w||**2/2
