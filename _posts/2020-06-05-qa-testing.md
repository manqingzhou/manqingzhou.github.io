If your goal is to launch a profitable, successful app, your first priority would not only be marketing -- it should be quality assurance.

Since finding and fixing bugs in your app has such a huge positive impact on retention, quality assurance may be a important investment. 

There are several different types of QA testings, all of which are important for ensuring your app is bug free. It has two categories, one is `Non-functional Testing` and another one is `Functional Testing`. 

Let's look at the four stages of non-functional testing: vulnerability, compatibility, usability(user can use the app without confusion) and performance.

**Performance Testing**, determine how an application will behave under various conditions.
- Load Testing, put increasing amounts of simulated demand on the software, application or website to verify it
- Stress Testing, how software would respond at or beyond its peak load
- Endurance Testing, analyze the behaviour of an application under a specific amount of load over longer amounts of time(compared with load tesing and stress testing)
- Spike Testing.
Functional testing is to make sure the app is running smoothly.

**Unit Testing**, break an application down into units - small pieces of source code that can be tested individually. The goal of this stage is to test each unit in isolation without looking at its role within application as a whole. 

**Integration Testing**, unlike unit testing, integration testing involves testing multiple units together to see how they perform function as a whole. 

The rest is system testing and acceptance testing.

Now that I talk about general methods, sometimes order matters. Unit testing is the first level of testing and is often performed by developers themselves.
