P_value:An important metric for feature selection since it shows the correlation between target and features(variables)[Example](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/12/introduction-to-feature-selection-methods-with-an-example-or-how-to-select-the-right-variables/)
Here, I want to address the importance of feature selection:
- It enables the machine learning algorithms to train faster
- It improves the accuracy of a model if the right sublet is chosen
- It reduces overfitting
