title: Phone Interview about Network Engineer
---
Okya, I did not post immediately after the phone interview cuz I was tired from my trip to Ottawa. I was meant to go to the career fair in ottawa, but I ended up studying at the University of Ottawa. I think that time I was studying a real case network automation and PCA and something else. I did not have Wi-Fi by the time, so I mainly used my data. Poor me!

Next day which is FEB 12, I was going to have a phone interview, so I just studied at BrigeHead for a little bit. I guess around two hours. **All OSPF AND BGP**stuff cuz I want to be prepared for the following interview. The question I will not post here cuz YOU can always find online. I would only mainly keep track of my technical questions.

A whole process of trouble shooting. THE interface was down, Why? Obviouslt, the first thing I can think of is **PING**. Then, I assume it is a physical layer problem. Check if the interface is up or not. SSH to the other device to see if is up. No, the ssh tunnel is always shut down. try, show arp table. AND bgp is IDLE, I WAS THINKING ABOUT THE DEFAULT ROUTE. WRONG! THEY ARE PHYSICALLY CONNECTED TO EACH OTHER. Okay, Then I would say, if the as number is the same or u point the wrong neighbor. The bonus solution is in my mind, would not share, LAMO. OKAY, thats enough sharing, just know what you need to do as a network engineer. That is all I want to say.
