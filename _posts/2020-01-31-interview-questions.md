title: Phone Interview with Lumentum
subtitle: My personal experience
---
I want to record my first phone interview ever. It is 3pm in the afternoon, I amat kingston.

The first question is tell me about ur experience before? I answered pretty bad i guess. Need to work on that later.

The next are some basic questions about my internship before? Like which model you use? I said Cisco. Then we talked about ACL, OSPF, BGP, VLAN, DHCP, VPN, DNS,,Firewall and how I troubleshoot network issues. Oh, I almost forgot about NAT.

Thats all the question I had, if there is another round, I would keep my blog updated.
