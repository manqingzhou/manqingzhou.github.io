Happy International Woman's Day.

Firewall is the barrier between a **trusted and untrusted network**. Before diving into statefull firewall. I wanna address what is a stateless firewall. This is when each packet is treated individually and we dont keep track of packets we have seen before or not. 

Okay, let me give you a small example of stateful firewall. A computer on the LAN uses its email client to a mail server to the Internet. The client will start from a TCP three-way handshake, with a TCP stateful table. And when we receive the `SYN_ACK` packet and we check the table to see if it is a legit packet.

Better solution with security zone. 
~~~
Traffic from a “high” security level to a “lower” security level is permitted.
Traffic from a “low” security level to a “higher” security level is denied.
~~~ 

If we want to make an exception, we can always permit traffic from WAN to LAN with an access-list. 

Most companies will have one or more servers that should be reachable from the Internet. Perhaps a mail or web server. Instead of placing these on the INSIDE, we use a third zone called the DMZ (Demilitarized Zone). Take a look at the picture below:

The DMZ security zone will have a security level that is between INSIDE AND OUTSIDE.
