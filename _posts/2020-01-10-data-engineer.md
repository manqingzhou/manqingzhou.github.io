In general, Data Engineers set up pipelines to injest streaming and batch data from many resources. Then, the pipelines perform basic extract, transform and load(ETL) processes to make data more usable. Later, these data will be utilized in machine learning methods and future processings.
## Skills
- [Python](#python)
- [SQL](#sql)
- [AWS platform](#aws-platform)
- [Spark](#spark)

## Python
Remember these libraries in python. `NumPy`,`Pandas`,`Matplotlib`,`scikit-learn`
. To start off, how do you use them to deal with outlier, missing or imbalanced data. Secondly, how do you choose representation feature. And when it comes to machine learning part, do you know model evaluation(Metrics), MSE, MAE, impurity function, cross-entrop, precision, recall, AUC, ROC, false positive and false negative.
## SQL
## AWS platform
## Spark
