title: Overview of high availability

Today is mother's day. Every single mother in the world dersers to be respected and loved. I love my mum so much that I bought Listerine for her. 

Today;s topic is significant for our network since we are talking about high availability in layer2 switch. I also wanna touch a little about spanning tree protocol but that would be when I can figure the advanced version out.

There are several ways we can work on it.
- Network Design
- Etherchannel on Cisco Switch
- First-Hop Redundancy protocol(FHRP)
- Supervisor redundancy
- Virtualization

Nothing explains better than visual picture:

First, what is a network design? This is when we talk about Cisco three-layered hierarchy
#Core Layer
* Low latency for traffic
* Redundancy tolerance
* High speed
* Simplicity and Efficiency

And then it would be `Distribution Layer`, the job of which is to connect `Core layer` and `Access layer`

As we all know the job of access layer. It is the direct connectivity to the end users, layer2 switching, **stp operations**, PoE, **Port-base Security**, **Dynamic arp inspection**.
