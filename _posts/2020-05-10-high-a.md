title: Overview of high availability

Today is mother's day. Every single mother in the world dersers to be respected and loved. I love my mum so much that I bought Listerine for her. 

Today;s topic is significant for our network since we are talking about high availability in layer2 switch. I also wanna touch a little about spanning tree protocol but that would be when I can figure the advanced version out.

There are several ways we can work on it.
- Network Design
- Etherchannel on Cisco Switch
- First-Hop Redundancy protocol(FHRP)
- Supervisor redundancy
- Virtualization

Nothing explains better than visual picture:

First, what is a network design? This is when we talk about Cisco three-layered hierarchy
#Core Layer
* Low latency for traffic
* Redundancy tolerance
* High speed
* Simplicity and Efficiency

And then it would be `Distribution Layer`, the job of which is to connect `Core layer` and `Access layer`

As we all know the job of access layer. It is the direct connectivity to the end users, layer2 switching, **stp operations**, PoE, **Port-base Security**, **Dynamic arp inspection**. 

**Aggregating switch links with Etherchannel**

Make sure all ports participating in Etherchannel have the same configuration
* Duplex
* Speed
* Native VLAN
* Allowed VLANs
* Switchport mode(access/trunk)

The interface can be configured into three modes like `On`, `Auto`, `Desirable`.
While desirable interface will actively ask the other side to become an ehtercha
nel while auto guy just wait passively for the other side.

Lets do a small experiment on GNS3.

~~~
Switch(config)#interface range gi0/0 - 1
Switch(config-if-range)#channel-group 1 mode desirable
~~~

**Hot Standby Router Protocol(HSRP)**
<img src="/img/posts/HSRP2.png" alt="another hsrp" align="center"/>
~~~
sw2(config-if)#int vlan 10
sw2(config-if)#standby 10 ip 172.31.10.254
sw2(config-if)#standby 10 priority 110 #default 100
sw2(config-if)#standby 10 preempt 
~~~
When you finish the configuration, you can just `show standby`.
In our case, we set switch 2 as the active switch for vlan 10 and the rest are just standby switch. We can also trigger the failover based on somehing like interface goes down
~~~
SW1(config)#int vlan 10
SW1(config-if)#standby 10 track 1 decrement 11
SW1(config-if)#standby 10 track 2 decrement 11 
SW1(config)#track 1 interface gigabitEthernet 1/2 line-protocol
SW1(config-track)#exit
SW1(config)#track 2 interface gigabitEthernet 2/1 line-protocol
SW1(config-track)#end
~~~
