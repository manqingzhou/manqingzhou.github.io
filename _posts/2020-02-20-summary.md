subtitle: Time to look back

It is always important to look back and seek improvement of yourself. I am the person who love to record my baby steps. It is been ten days since I updated my blog. Before I jumped into my technical memory. I need to confess that I had a crunsh on somebody and I am trying to be forward. **IT IS SUPER HARD FOR ME TO MAKE THE FIRST MOVE**. Sometimes I am confused if you are interested in me or not. Anyway, before jumping into network stuff, lets solve two coding questions.
**Breadth First Search**
~~~
class Graph:
	
	# Constructor
	def __init__(self):
		# default dictionary to store graph
		self.graph = dict(list)
	
	# function to add an edge to the graph
	def addEdge(self, u, v):
		self.graph[u].append(v)

	#Function to print BFS of a graph
	def BFS(self, s):
		
		#Mark all the vertices as not visited 
		visited = [False] * (len(self.graph))
		
		# Mark the source node as visited and enqueue it
		queue.append(s)
		visited[s] = True
		
		while queue:
			
			# Dequeue a vertex from queue and print it
			s = queue.pop(0)
			print(s, end = " ")
			
			# Get all the adjacent vertices of the dequeued vertex s.
			# If a adjacent has not been visited, then mark it as 
			# visited and enqueue it.
			
			for i in self.graph[s]:
				if visited[i] == False:
					queue.append(i)
					visited[i] = True
