title: Simulate System Load
layout: post
---
We often need to discover how the performance of an application is affected when the system is under certain types of loads. This means artificial load must be re-created.

Before that, I need to address the difference between `/dev/zero` and `/dev/null`, /dev/zero produces **a continuous stream of NULL(zero value) bytes** while /dev/null produces no output. So, we could say we use /dev/zero to create dummy files or swap.

**Disk**

We will create disk I/O by firstly creating a file, and then use a for loop to repeatedly copy it.

1. Generate a 1GB of file
~~~
dd if=/dev/zero of=file bs=1M count=1024
~~~
2. a loop that runs 10 times
~~~
for i in {1..10}; do cp file file1; done
~~~

The orginal post also mention how to drain CPU and RAM.
