In the part of supervised models, I talked a lot about classification. In this article, I am just jump into unsupervised models and how they work differently. If you have any confusions about basic concepts about machine learning, you are welcome to read 'Part One'.

## Unsupervised models
Inputs are continuous or categorical. Goal is to group data cases into a finite number of clusters so that within each cluster all cases have very similar inputs. We can put emerging similar topics in one cluster for news.
