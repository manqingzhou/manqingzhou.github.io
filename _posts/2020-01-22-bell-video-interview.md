It is gonna be be my first 'phone interview'. I am now trying to record what I need to do for this interview (around 20 minutes based on the description).

**ALL MY ANSWERS ARE BASED ON MY OWN EXPERIENCE**

To start off, I need to know the culture in Bell and why it attracts me(LIKE WHY I PICK THIS COMPANY, THERE MUST BE A REASON BEHIND IT).
 
**WHY BELL**

To start off, it is canada's top ten company and the best diversity employee. As a asian woman, I really appreciate the efforts that Bell made for the education and career development for woman. Also, Bell cares about the mental health of people in general, I often see the event--Bell, lets talk in our campus. In the end, I really love the enviroment bell provide for interns and I look forward to working with those fantastic people.

**How did you prepare for the interview**

I did bunch of research on the company website, like the culture and diversity of bell, what is like to work for bell. What kind of product bell is working on. I want to know almost everything about bell cuz I am really intrested in working for bell. Also, I did ask for advice from one of my friend who applied for Bell before. She helped me a lot. 

**What is my greatest strength**

I am a pretty task-driven person. If I am given a project, I would set a goal about what I should do in the following days.For example, if need to code, i would firstly think about how to best solve the problem and then write functions little by little. If I have problems during the project, I would love to solve by myself cuz I love challenges. If I TRIED AND I CANNOT SOLVE IT, I WOULD NOT WASTE ANY TIIME AND WOULD SEEK HELP FROM MY COWORKERS.

**Add one feature to the iphone**

I always want to make a text group in my iphone. Every single time, I want to send message to multiple people. I need to send the message one by one. Or I could copy paste my content. It is too much efforts. I know I can  make a group at facebook, but some people dont have it. So, i really want to add a text group feature in my iphone.

**Describe a time u did extra work for the group**

I want to talk about a final project. It was supposed to be a two-person job. But my teammate was busy with another course machine learn. So I need to finish all the coding part of this course. The professor did give us some instrustions but they were pretty messy and not very clear. So on one hand, I went to the TA office multiple times to discuss about the final projects and did some research online. I was so happy that I finished all the coding in the end and got all the graphs. I also helped other people with the final project. By the way, got A+ for that course.

**How do you solve conflicts and tell me the toughest team you work with**

I personally not the person who would initiate the conflicts. If there is going be one, I would say say, Okay, calm down, we can sit and discuss about it. There is no right answer to any questions. We can totally share thoughts and come up with a ideal solution. There was a time, one of my team member contributed nothing to the assignment. It is a group presentation. So, me and another person, we tried to contact her and failed. So, we decide to finish everything and we added her in the presentation. But we also talked about contributions in the end. It is fair to mention contributions in any case. People are not blinded.

**What are you passionate about outside school**

I mean when I am not coding or trying to handle my assignment. I love to dance, I really like it!! Mostly jazz. When I was dancing or learning a new move. I am so happy and enjoy it a lot. Also, I meet several good friends during the dance. Another thing i really enjoy is volunteering. I would do something to help people.It is not something that money can buy. You help people and you make people happy. I was volunteering for queen's international center. There are mnay people come to canada for the first time, I want to make them feel like home here. I guess the reason I really want to spend my spare time doing this is that if i have not received help from those kind people, i would not be me right now.

**What is my proudest achievement**

There are many moments i was pretty proud of myself. I am gonna talk about the most recent one. Last winter, I was doing a course, bioinformatics, it was beyond my knowledge. I did not have a deep bio background, so i needed to read extra papers to understand the terms in the slides. Also, when it comes to the final project, my team mate was busy with another course, so i gotta do what i gotta do. I need to finish all the code part. Even we had some instructions from the prof. It was still pretty challenges. OFFICE+EXTRA STUDYING HOURS. I DID A PERFECT PRESENTATION AND I GOT A+. Oh, did i mention that i also teach my fellows about it. haha
