May is here and pandemic is still here too. The weather in kingston is getting warmer.

The main function of GRE tunnel is to tunnel one protocol with another. The protocol being tunneled is the `passenger protocol` and the protocol tunneling the passenger is the `transport protocol`.

In one word, **Tunnel encrypted private traffic through the public internet**.

Some may wonder what is the different between gre and ipsec vpn? well, gre can encapsulate multicast traffic.
