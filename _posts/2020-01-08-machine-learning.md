Welcome to the world of **machine learning** and **deep learning**. The main idea behind it is to train machine to learn from data so it can solve new cases even when the data changes. Besides, there are different types of learning tasks such as supervised learning(classification, regression, time series prediction) or unsupervised learning(clustering). Here, I need to touch on reinforcement learning in case i get confused in the future. So, there would be reward and penalty in reinforcement learning and the outcome is to choose best policy to maxmize rewards and avoid penaltie through learning from the past.

## Classification models
Outputs are categorical and inputs are anything. Goal is to select correct class(label) for new inputs.The simplest case is a choice between 1 and 0.

Here, I need to address the difference between classification and regression . In the latter case, outputs are continnuous. But the goal is similar which is to predict outputs accurately for new inputs. We can use it to predict the price of astock in 6 months time.
 
## Model fitting and selection

## Unsupervised models
Inputs are continuous or categorical. Goal is to group data cases into a finite number of clusters so that within each cluster all cases have very similar inputs. We can put emerging similar topics in one cluster for news.
