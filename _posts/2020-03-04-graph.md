title: Breadth First Search For a Graph
---
Remeber few days ago, I was using BFS for tree traveral layer by layer, We initilize the levels = [], and for each layer of tree, we add another level. we use `queue = deque([root,])` and while queue is not empty, we continue the loop. We use the lengh of the layer to do the `popleft()` and `levels[level].append(node.val)`. The thing about graph here is that we need to keep track of the node we visited and then do the BFS for the not visited node. We may have two functions here to help us implement that.

Lets keep our logic clear with a small demonstration.

We start from the vertex 2 and when we reach vertex 0, keep in mind,2 is also an adjacent vertex of 0. That's why we need to mark visited vertex. The path would be 2,0,3,1.

        self.graph = defaultdict(list) 
  
    # function to add an edge to graph 
    def addEdge(self,u,v): 
        self.graph[u].append(v) 
  
    # Function to print a BFS of graph 
    def BFS(self, s): 
  
        # Mark all the vertices as not visited 
        visited = [False] * (len(self.graph)) 
  
        # Create a queue for BFS 
        queue = [] 
  
        # Mark the source node as  
        # visited and enqueue it 
        queue.append(s) 
        visited[s] = True
  
        while queue: 
  
            # Dequeue a vertex from  
            # queue and print it 
            s = queue.pop(0) 
            print (s, end = " ") 
  
            # Get all adjacent vertices of the 
            # dequeued vertex s. If a adjacent 
            # has not been visited, then mark it 
            # visited and enqueue it 
            for i in self.graph[s]: 
                if visited[i] == False: 
                    queue.append(i) 
                    visited[i] = True
