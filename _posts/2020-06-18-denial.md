Let us start this with ARP cache poisoning. Sending out a single spoofed ARP packet to the router on the LAN, the attacker can poison the router's cache so that it will send packets to non-exsit MAC address on the LAN. So the victim machines would not receive any traffic, resulting a Dos attack by stopping the service from communicating.

TCP connections are torn down when one of the communicating machine sends a `FIN` or `RESET` packet to the other side.
