##EDUCATION
Master of Electrical and Computer Engineering
Queen's University-Kingstion,Ontario                September.2018-December.2019
- Relevant courses: reinforcement learning, introduction to machine learning, werable and IOT, cyber security and bioinformatics
- Relevant projects(**ALL WRITTEN IN PYTHON**)
1.Self-driving Cab. Using Q-learning and Q-learning lambda algorithems to improve the efficency of picking up passengers in a 6*6 grids. The total time is reduced from around 1000s to 13s by learning from past experience.
2.Predict loads in hand from EMG signal. Predict patients' next move based on their EMG signal. In the machine learning part, data is splitted into **70%** training and **30%**test and got the 90% accuracy score with random forest.
3.Genetic association in children behavior base on CBCL(Children Behavior Checklist). Analyze genetic data with plink&R and found out 11 significant SNPs correlated with cognitive behaviors.
