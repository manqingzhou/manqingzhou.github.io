# Computing an Average
## Find the average salary for all employee as well as the average salary for each department
~~~
select avg(sal) as avg_sal
from emp

select avg(sal) as avg_sal
from emp
group by deptno
~~~
`group by` automatically cause aggregate function such as AVG to execute and return a result for each group

If you want to find the max or min of the group, sub avg to `min` and `max` function.

Do you want to count how many rows, use function `count (*)` or if you want to know how many in depno 10 or depno 20?
~~~
select depno, count (*)
from emp
group by depno
~~~
When you use `count(*)`, you are counting the whole rows, but when you **COUNT**a column, you are counting the `non-NULL` value in that column.

I would add some later, now I need to focus on understanding not my note.
