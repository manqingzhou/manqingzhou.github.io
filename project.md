1. **Self-driven Cab**
    * Using reinforcement learning algorithms to solve classic driver-passenger problem
    * [tutorials to help you understand the principle](https://towardsdatascience.com/reinforcement-learning-towards-general-ai-1bd68256c72d)
    * [Code](https://github.com/manqingzhou/self-driven-cab)

1. **EMG signal analysis with prediction model**
    * Recognizing the pattern of movement by analyzing the EMG signal
    * [final project paper](/img/personal/Elec_811_Final_Project.pdf)
    * [Code](https://github.com/manqingzhou/emg-signal-analysis)

1. **User Recognization From Walking Activity**
    * Starting from de-noising the dataset to feature selection and prediction. It is a complete beginner project
